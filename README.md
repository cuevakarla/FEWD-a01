FEWD assignment 1


## background
Coming from a graphic design (mainly print-based) background, web and digital design is something that always ends up overlapping in my projects. I am hoping to expand my skills in the digital world and learn new programs. I took one course in html years ago but that has been the extent of my knowledge since.

## why code
I'm interested in learning code because I have always been intrigued by how different the process is to design through code verses conventional adobe programs. Not to mention it would inheriently expand my skills as a professional designer. I don't have too much to experience in web design aside from what I have learned so far in class, so anything new is exciting and rewarding.

## hobbies
When I am not busy with normal adulting duties, I like to spend time with friends and family. I really enojoy trying new things, not limited to the following:
* new restaurants
* bars and breweries
* traveling
* petting dogs
* art & design (appreciating and creating in all forms)
